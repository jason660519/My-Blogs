**Conclusion and Insights First**: Over the next two years, AMD's stock price will soar and liquidity will dry up. The same procurement demand, when processed through alien minds, becomes surprisingly simple and brutal. They will create $100 billion and $600 billion out of thin air on Earth, which for both parties and global investors is just a matter of time - a simple, inevitable outcome.

## Background:

On October 7, 2025, OpenAI and AMD reached a strategic partnership, causing AMD's stock price to surge 25%. Partnership details: OpenAI will acquire up to 160 million AMD shares through "performance warrants" at just $0.01 per share (far below the market price of approximately $165), equivalent to nearly 10% of AMD's equity.

Currently (October 7, 2025), AMD has 1.62 billion total shares outstanding, trading at $210, with a total market cap of $340.2 billion. If AMD's total shares remain at 1.62 billion and the stock price reaches $600, the total market cap would reach $972 billion. What are the calculations behind **Su Bae** and **Sam Altman's** strategy?

### **AMD (Su Bae's) Calculation: Trading "Future Ownership" for "Current Market Cap Explosion"**

* **Her Investment**: Giving away nearly 10% of company ownership (162 million shares) almost for free to OpenAI.
* **Her Target Return**: Securing OpenAI's long-term large-scale order commitments, which becomes a "super catalyst" that ignites market confidence, pushing the company's market cap from $340 billion to $970 billion.

**The Deep Logic Behind This:**

1. **Extremely High Leverage Effect**: She gave away 10% equity but gained nearly 3x value increase for the remaining 90% equity. This is an extremely profitable deal for existing shareholders (including herself).
2. **Establishing AI Market Position**: This isn't just financial maneuvering, but strategic positioning. Locking in OpenAI as a flagship customer announces to the world: "AMD is Nvidia's top alternative in the AI chip market." This attracts more customers, developers, and investors, creating a virtuous cycle.
3. **Dilution Cost vs. Growth Benefits**: While existing shareholders' equity is diluted by 10%, the total value of their holdings increases dramatically. This is a classic "make the pie bigger - even if your percentage gets smaller, your actual slice becomes several times larger" strategy.

**Conclusion**: Su Bae's calculation is "sacrifice small pie, make big pie" - using 10% equity as bait to leverage a nearly trillion-dollar market cap empire, making all shareholders (including herself) significantly wealthier.

### **OpenAI's Calculation: Trading "Procurement Commitments" for "Nearly Cost-Free Hundred Billion Dollar Windfall"**

* **OpenAI's Investment**: Committing to purchase billions of dollars worth of chips from AMD over the coming years. (These chips are what OpenAI would need to buy anyway.)
* **OpenAI's Financial Gain**: **Nearly cost-free** acquisition of $97.2 billion

# What I See Isn't Just News, It's an "Exchange Voucher"

### **Just 13 AMD Shares: Let AMD + OpenAI Pay Your Bills Within 2 Years!**

10-year top-tier PC + 10-year AI subscription, total value over $5,400, now pre-orderable with just $2,730 principal.

While everyone else is still discussing AMD and OpenAI's hundred-billion-dollar partnership, I've already calculated how to make this alliance pay for me directly.

**Elementary School Math:**

* **My Goal**: A $3,000 top-spec AMD PC + 10 years of $2,400 OpenAI subscription.
* **My Method**: Buy 13 AMD shares at $210 per share.
* **My Plan**: Sell when the stock price reaches $600.
* **My Profit**: $5,070 net profit, directly covering my entire wish list.

**Why within 2 years?**
Because AI development is measured in months. OpenAI's massive orders and AMD Instinct GPU's continued volume growth will ignite revenue and stock prices over the next few quarters. Markets don't believe in miracles, only in results - and AMD's results are on the way.

**My Risk Management Method isn't fear, but discipline:**

1. This $2,730 USD is money I "can afford to lose" without affecting my life.
2. I'll sell in stages: sell some at $400 to lock in profits, sell more at $600. Never be greedy.
